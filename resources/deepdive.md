This guide is the practical companion to the main [README](../README.md).
The README explains what llm.rb is. This document shows how to use it.

## Mental Model

Everything in llm.rb builds on three concepts:

- Provider: the model backend
- Context: the execution state
- Tools: external work the model can request

Most features extend these, rather than introducing new abstractions.

## Providers

Start with a provider and a context. From there, you can add schemas, tools,
MCP, persistence, streaming, and other features without changing the overall
shape of the code.

In llm.rb, `LLM::Context` is the main execution boundary. It keeps message
history, provider params, tool state, and usage together, so you can keep
building on the same object instead of switching to a different abstraction
for each feature.

Those context-level defaults are not fixed. You can override them on a single
`talk` or `respond` call by passing request params directly, which makes it
easy to keep stable defaults at the context level while changing things like
`model`, `schema`, `tools`, or `stream` for one turn.

### Supported Providers

llm.rb supports multiple LLM providers behind one API surface:

- **OpenAI** (`LLM.openai`)
- **Anthropic** (`LLM.anthropic`)
- **Google** (`LLM.google`)
- **DeepSeek** (`LLM.deepseek`)
- **xAI** (`LLM.xai`)
- **zAI** (`LLM.zai`)
- **Ollama** (`LLM.ollama`)
- **Llama.cpp** (`LLM.llamacpp`)

### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Many providers expose an OpenAI-compatible API without using OpenAI's exact
infrastructure or URL layout. In llm.rb, `host:` controls where requests go,
and `base_path:` controls the API prefix used to build endpoint paths.

For providers that keep OpenAI's usual `/v1/...` layout, overriding `host:` is
often enough:

```ruby
llm = LLM.openai(
  key: ENV["DEEPSEEK_KEY"],
  host: "api.deepseek.com"
)
```

That said, if llm.rb has a native provider for the service, prefer that over
the generic OpenAI-compatible path. For example, `LLM.deepseek(...)` is the
better default for DeepSeek even though `LLM.openai(host: "api.deepseek.com", ...)`
can work too.

Some providers also change the base path. DeepInfra is one example: its
OpenAI-compatible API lives under `/v1/openai/...`, so both `host:` and
`base_path:` need to be set:

```ruby
llm = LLM.openai(
  key: ENV["DEEPINFRA_TOKEN"],
  host: "api.deepinfra.com",
  base_path: "/v1/openai"
)
```

This same pattern also works for proxies, gateways, and self-hosted
OpenAI-compatible servers that preserve the request schema but change the URL
layout.

### Basic Context

At the simplest level, any object that implements `#<<` can receive visible
output as it arrives. That includes `$stdout`, `StringIO`, files, sockets,
and other Ruby IO-style objects.

This is the smallest complete llm.rb loop: a provider, a context, and a place
for streamed output to go. Once that is in place, the rest of the library
builds outward from the same pattern:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout)

loop do
  print "> "
  ctx.talk(STDIN.gets || break)
  puts
end
```

Context defaults can still be overridden on a single turn. That is useful when
most turns should share one setup, but a specific request needs a different
model, schema, tool set, or stream target:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, model: "gpt-4.1-mini", stream: $stdout)

ctx.talk("Answer normally.")
ctx.talk("Now return JSON.", schema: Report, stream: nil, model: "gpt-4.1")
```

### Responses API

llm.rb also supports OpenAI's Responses API through `LLM::Context` with
`mode: :responses`. The important switch is `store:`. With `store: false`, the
Responses API stays stateless while still using the Responses endpoint. With
`store: true`, OpenAI can keep response state server-side and reduce how much
conversation state needs to be sent on each turn.

Use this when you want the Responses API specifically, not just normal chat
completions. llm.rb keeps it behind the same context interface so the rest of
your application code does not need to change much:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, mode: :responses, store: false)

ctx.talk("Your task is to answer the user's questions", role: :developer)
res = ctx.talk("What is the capital of France?")
puts res.content
```

## Responses

The response side follows the same idea as the rest of llm.rb. APIs that make
model requests return
[`LLM::Response`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Response.html)
objects as a common base shape, then layer on extra behavior when an endpoint
or provider needs something more specific.

That base wrapper still keeps the raw `Net::HTTPResponse` on `response.res`,
so normalization does not cut you off from low-level HTTP access when you need
to inspect headers, status, or other transport details.

Some response adapters also add `Enumerable`, so list-style and search-style
results can often be iterated directly without reaching into `response.data`.

## Streaming

Streaming ranges from plain visible output to structured callbacks that can
drive tool execution while the model is still responding.

The simple form is just an object that implements `#<<`. The advanced form is
`LLM::Stream`, which gives you explicit callbacks for visible output,
reasoning output, and tool-call lifecycle events.

### Basic Streaming

At the lowest level, any object that responds to `#<<` can receive visible
output chunks.

This is the easiest way to make the model feel responsive. It works well for
CLI tools, logs, and any interface where plain visible output is enough:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
ctx.talk("Explain how TCP keepalive works in one paragraph.")
puts
```

### Advanced Streaming

Use [`LLM::Stream`](../lib/llm/stream.rb) when you want structured callbacks
such as `on_content`, `on_reasoning_content`, `on_tool_call`, and
`on_tool_return`.

This is the version to use when streaming is part of control flow, not just
presentation. It lets your code react to output, reasoning, and tool events
as they happen:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_content(content)
    $stdout << content
  end

  def on_reasoning_content(content)
    $stderr << content
  end

  def on_tool_call(tool, error)
    $stdout << "Running tool #{tool.name}\n"
    queue << (error || ctx.spawn(tool, :thread))
  end

  def on_tool_return(tool, result)
    if result.error?
      $stdout << "Tool #{tool.name} failed\n"
    else
      $stdout << "Finished tool #{tool.name}\n"
    end
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
stream = Stream.new
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream:, tools: [System])

ctx.talk("Run `date` and `uname -a`.")
ctx.talk(ctx.wait(:thread)) while ctx.functions.any?
```

If streamed tool calls mix MCP tools with local class-based tools, you can
choose the strategy per tool inside `on_tool_call` so MCP tools stay on a
supported concurrency mode while local class-based tools use experimental
`:ractor` execution. In that case, `wait(...)` can accept an array of
possible concurrency strategies such as `[:thread, :ractor]`, so llm.rb waits
on whichever of those strategies are actually present:

```ruby
class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_tool_call(tool, error)
    return queue << error if error
    queue << (tool.mcp? ? ctx.spawn(tool, :thread) : ctx.spawn(tool, :ractor))
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
stream = Stream.new
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream:, tools: [System, *mcp_tools])

ctx.talk("Check the deployment status and compare it with local system time.")
ctx.talk(ctx.wait([:thread, :ractor])) while ctx.functions.any?
```

### Stream Compaction Events

Long-lived contexts can compact older history into a summary through
[`LLM::Compactor`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Compactor.html).
When a stream is present, that lifecycle is exposed through
[`LLM::Stream`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html) with
`on_compaction` and `on_compaction_finish`. The compactor can also use its own
`model:` when you want summarization to run on a different model from the main
context. `token_threshold:` accepts either a fixed token count or a
percentage string like `"90%"`, which resolves against the current model
context window and triggers compaction once total token usage goes over that
percentage.

This is useful when you want to log or surface the moment a context is
compacted without treating compaction as a tool call:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_compaction(ctx, compactor)
    $stdout.puts "Compacting #{ctx.messages.size} messages..."
  end

  def on_compaction_finish(ctx, compactor)
    $stdout.puts "Compacted to #{ctx.messages.size} messages."
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(
  llm,
  stream: Stream.new,
  compactor: {
    token_threshold: "90%",
    retention_window: 8,
    model: "gpt-5.4-mini"
  }
)
```

### Stream Transform Events

Context transformers can also surface lifecycle events through
[`LLM::Stream`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html). This is a
good fit for UI messaging around request rewriting, such as showing that data
is being anonymized before the request goes out:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_transform(ctx, transformer)
    $stdout << "Anonymizing your data...\n"
  end

  def on_transform_finish(ctx, transformer)
    $stdout << "Data anonymized.\n"
  end
end

class ScrubPII
  def call(ctx, prompt, params)
    [prompt, params]
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: Stream.new, transformer: ScrubPII.new)
ctx.talk("Email me at developer@example.com")
```

### Manual Compaction

You can also assign a compactor to a context and manage compaction manually.
If you do not configure `message_threshold:` or `token_threshold:`, automatic
compaction stays disabled and you can call `compact!` yourself when the
workflow decides it is time:

```ruby
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.compactor = {retention_window: 8, model: "gpt-5.4-mini"}

# ...later...
ctx.compactor.compact!
```

### Percentage Token Thresholds

`token_threshold:` can be a percentage string like `"90%"`. In that form,
llm.rb resolves the threshold against `ctx.context_window` and compares the
resulting token count to the current `usage.total_tokens`. This is useful when
you want compaction to begin near the edge of the model's real context window
without hard-coding a provider-specific token count.

Plainly: `"90%"` means compaction starts once total token usage goes over 90%
of the context window.

If the context window is unknown and `ctx.context_window` returns `0`, the
percentage threshold is treated as disabled. In that case, pair it with a
`message_threshold:` or use a fixed integer `token_threshold:` if you want a
fallback policy.

```ruby
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, model: "gpt-5.4-mini")
ctx.compactor = {token_threshold: "90%", retention_window: 8}
```

### Creating Your Own Compactor

If the built-in policy is not the right fit, create your own compactor by
subclassing [`LLM::Compactor`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Compactor.html).
The intended extension point is to implement both `compactable?` and
`compact!`:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class Compactor < LLM::Compactor
  def compact?(prompt = nil)
    ctx.messages.size > 100
  end

  def compact!(prompt = nil)
    return unless compact?(prompt)
    summary = LLM::Message.new("user", "Summary goes here")
    ctx.messages.replace([summary, *ctx.messages.last(8)])
    summary
  end
end

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.compactor = Compactor.new(ctx)
```

## Reasoning

Some providers expose model reasoning separately from visible assistant output.
llm.rb lets you handle that in two ways: stream it as it arrives, or read it
from the final response when the provider includes it.

This is part of the normal response model. Completion-style responses expose
`reasoning_content`, and streamed providers can emit reasoning incrementally
through `LLM::Stream#on_reasoning_content`.

### Stream Reasoning Output

Use `LLM::Stream#on_reasoning_content` when you want reasoning output as a
separate stream.

If the provider emits reasoning incrementally, this lets you surface or log it
without mixing it into the assistant-visible response stream:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class Stream < LLM::Stream
  def on_content(content)
    $stdout << content
  end

  def on_reasoning_content(content)
    $stderr << content
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(
  llm,
  model: "gpt-5.4-mini",
  mode: :responses,
  reasoning: {effort: "medium"},
  stream: Stream.new
)
ctx.talk("Solve 17 * 19 and show your work.")
```

### Read Reasoning From The Response

When a provider includes reasoning content in the final completion, it is also
available on the response object.

This is useful when you want the final response first and only inspect the
reasoning afterward, for example in debugging or offline analysis:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.deepseek(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, model: "deepseek-reasoner")
res = ctx.talk("Solve 17 * 19 and show your work.")

puts res.content
puts res.reasoning_content
```

## Structured Outputs

The `LLM::Schema` system lets you define JSON schemas for structured outputs.
Schemas can be defined as classes with `property` declarations or built
programmatically using a fluent interface. When you pass a schema to a
context, llm.rb adapts it into the provider's structured-output format when
that provider supports one.

The useful part is that the schema stays in Ruby. You describe the shape once,
attach it to the context, and let llm.rb adapt it to the provider API instead
of hand-writing JSON Schema payloads for each request:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "pp"

class Report < LLM::Schema
  property :category, Enum["performance", "security", "outage"], "Report category", required: true
  property :summary, String, "Short summary", required: true
  property :impact, OneOf[String, Integer], "Primary impact, as text or a count", required: true
  property :services, Array[String], "Impacted services", required: true
  property :timestamp, String, "When it happened", optional: true
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, schema: Report)
res = ctx.talk("Structure this report: 'Database latency spiked at 10:42 UTC, causing 5% request timeouts for 12 minutes.'")
pp res.content!
```

### Fluent Schemas

If you do not want a class, you can build the schema inline.

This style is useful for one-off workflows or dynamic schemas that do not need
their own constant:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "pp"

schema = LLM::Schema.new.object(
  category: LLM::Schema.new.string.enum("performance", "security", "outage").required,
  summary: LLM::Schema.new.string.required,
  services: LLM::Schema.new.array(LLM::Schema.new.string).required
)

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, schema:)
res = ctx.talk("Structure this report: 'API latency spiked for the billing service.'")
pp res.content!
```

## Persistence

Contexts can be serialized and restored across process boundaries. That gives
you a straightforward way to persist long-lived conversation state between
requests, jobs, retries, or deployments.

This works because `LLM::Context` already holds the state that matters:
messages, tool returns, usage, and provider-facing parameters. Persistence is
therefore mostly about choosing where to store that snapshot.

### Save To A File

File-based persistence is the simplest way to see how context serialization
works. It is useful for scripts, local tools, and any workflow where a JSON
snapshot is enough.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.talk("Hello")
ctx.talk("Remember that my favorite language is Ruby")

payload = ctx.to_json

restored = LLM::Context.new(llm)
restored.restore(string: payload)
puts restored.talk("What is my favorite language?").content

ctx.save(path: "context.json")

restored = LLM::Context.new(llm)
restored.restore(path: "context.json")
puts restored.talk("What is my favorite language?").content
```

### Persist With ActiveRecord

llm.rb has ActiveRecord support built in through `acts_as_llm`, which can be
applied to any ActiveRecord model. The built-in persistence contract is one
`data` column that stores the serialized runtime. Provider selection, model
selection, and any extra mirrored fields are application concerns that you
provide to llm.rb through `provider:`, `context:`, and `tracer:` hooks.

That means:

- `provider:` should resolve an `LLM::Provider` instance
- `context:` can inject defaults such as `model:`, `mode:`, `store:`, or tools
- usage comes from the serialized runtime state through `ctx.usage`, not from
  dedicated database columns
- if your app wants `provider`, `model`, or token columns, you can still add
  them and read them from your own hook methods

The wrapper persists `LLM::Context` as JSON. On PostgreSQL, you can store that
runtime state in a `jsonb` column instead of plain text:

- `format: :string` stores the context as a JSON string in a text column.
- `format: :json` or `format: :jsonb` stores the context as a structured JSON
  object, which is useful for native JSON columns such as PostgreSQL `jsonb`.
  These formats expect a real JSON column type with ActiveRecord JSON
  typecasting enabled for the model.
- `tracer:` accepts a tracer or proc and assigns it through `llm.tracer = ...`
  on the resolved provider. That sets the provider's default tracer so it
  keeps working across normal tasks, threads, and fibers that share the same
  provider instance. Use `llm.with_tracer(...)` when you want a temporary
  scoped override for the current fiber.
- `provider:`, `context:`, and `tracer:` can also be symbols that call
  methods on the model.

```ruby
create_table :contexts do |t|
  t.text :data
  t.timestamps
end
```

```ruby
require "llm"
require "net/http/persistent"
require "active_record"
require "llm/active_record"

class Context < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_llm provider: :set_provider, context: :set_context, tracer: :set_tracer

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"]).persistent
  end

  def set_tracer
    LLM::Tracer::Logger.new(llm, io: $stdout)
  end

  def set_context
    {model: "gpt-5.4-mini", mode: :responses, store: false}
  end
end

ctx = Context.create!
ctx.talk("Remember that my favorite language is Ruby")
puts ctx.talk("What is my favorite language?").content
puts ctx.usage.total_tokens
```

If your app already has provider or model columns, wire them through your own
hooks:

```ruby
create_table :contexts do |t|
  t.string :provider_name
  t.string :provider_key
  t.string :model_name
  t.text :data
  t.timestamps
end
```

```ruby
require "llm"
require "active_record"
require "llm/active_record"

class Context < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_llm provider: :set_provider, context: :set_context

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.public_send(provider_name, key: provider_key)
  end

  def set_context
    {model: model_name, mode: :responses, store: false}
  end
end

ctx = Context.create!(provider_name: "openai", provider_key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"], model_name: "gpt-5.4-mini")
ctx.talk("Remember that my favorite language is Ruby")
puts ctx.talk("What is my favorite language?").content
```

The `acts_as_llm` method wraps
[`LLM::Context`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html) and
provides full control over tool execution.

`context:` lets the model provide default options to the constructed
`LLM::Context`, while still allowing individual `talk` and `respond` calls to
override them when a specific turn needs different behavior. One common use is
setting default tools:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "net/http/persistent"
require "active_record"
require "llm/active_record"

##
# A small tool that gives the LLM access to the current time in UTC.
class Clock < LLM::Tool
  name "clock"
  description "Return the current UTC time"

  def call
    {time: Time.now.utc.iso8601}
  end
end

##
# The ActiveRecord model owns the serialized context and injects a default
# tool through `context:`.
class Context < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_llm provider: :set_provider, context: :set_context, format: :jsonb

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"]).persistent
  end

  def set_context
    {model: "gpt-5.4-mini", tools: [Clock]}
  end
end

ctx = Context.create!
ctx.talk("What time is it in UTC right now?")
while ctx.functions.any?
  puts ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)).content
end
```

The `acts_as_agent` method wraps
[`LLM::Agent`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html) and manages
tool execution for you.

Its `provider:`, `context:`, and `tracer:` hooks can also be configured as
symbols that call methods on the model. It follows the same data-column-only
contract as `acts_as_llm`: provider instances come from your hooks, model
defaults come from agent DSL or `context:`, and usage comes from serialized
runtime state.

```ruby
require "llm"
require "active_record"
require "llm/active_record"

class Ticket < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_agent provider: :set_provider do
    model "gpt-5.4-mini"
    instructions "You are a concise support assistant."
    tools SearchDocs, Escalate
    concurrency :thread
  end

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"])
  end

  def set_context
    {mode: :responses, store: false}
  end
end

ticket = Ticket.create!
puts ticket.talk("How do I rotate my API key?").content
```

If your app already has provider or model columns, plug them into the same
hooks:

```ruby
create_table :tickets do |t|
  t.string :provider_name
  t.string :provider_key
  t.text :data
  t.timestamps
end
```

```ruby
require "llm"
require "active_record"
require "llm/active_record"

class Ticket < ApplicationRecord
  acts_as_agent provider: :set_provider, context: :set_context do
    model "gpt-5.4-mini"
    instructions "You are a concise support assistant."
    tools SearchDocs, Escalate
    concurrency :thread
  end

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.public_send(provider_name, key: provider_key)
  end

  def set_context
    {mode: :responses, store: false}
  end
end

ticket = Ticket.create!(provider_name: "openai", provider_key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"])
puts ticket.talk("How do I rotate my API key?").content
```

### Persist With Sequel

llm.rb has Sequel support built in through `plugin :llm` and `plugin :agent`,
which can be applied to any `Sequel::Model`. Their built-in persistence
contract is the serialized `data` column. Provider selection, model defaults,
and any extra mirrored fields are application concerns that you provide to
llm.rb through `provider:`, `context:`, and `tracer:` hooks. `plugin :llm`
persists `LLM::Context`, while `plugin :agent` persists `LLM::Agent`. On
PostgreSQL, that runtime state can be stored in a `jsonb` column instead of
plain text:

- `format: :string` stores the context as a JSON string in a text column.
- `format: :json` or `format: :jsonb` stores the context as a structured JSON
  object, which is useful for native JSON columns such as PostgreSQL `jsonb`.
  These formats expect a real JSON column type with Sequel JSON typecasting
  enabled for the model.
- `tracer:` accepts a tracer or proc and assigns it through `llm.tracer = ...`
  on the resolved provider. That sets the provider's default tracer so it
  keeps working across normal tasks, threads, and fibers that share the same
  provider instance. Use `llm.with_tracer(...)` when you want a temporary
  scoped override for the current fiber.
- `provider:`, `context:`, and `tracer:` can also be symbols that call
  methods on the model.

**Migration:**

```ruby
create_table :contexts do
  primary_key :id
  String :data, text: true
end
```

```ruby
require "llm"
require "net/http/persistent"
require "sequel"
require "sequel/plugins/llm"

class Context < Sequel::Model
  plugin :llm, provider: :set_provider, context: :set_context, tracer: :set_tracer, format: :jsonb

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"]).persistent
  end

  def set_tracer
    LLM::Tracer::Logger.new(llm, io: $stdout)
  end

  def set_context
    {model: "gpt-5.4-mini", mode: :responses, store: false}
  end
end

ctx = Context.create
ctx.talk("Remember that my favorite language is Ruby")
puts ctx.talk("What is my favorite language?").content
puts ctx.usage.total_tokens
```

`context:` lets the plugin inject default options into the constructed
`LLM::Context`. Those defaults still live at the context layer, so they can be
overridden on individual `talk` or `respond` calls when a specific turn needs
different behavior. One common use is setting default tools this way, but the
same hook can also preload schemas, stream handlers, or other context-level
options:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "net/http/persistent"
require "sequel"
require "sequel/plugins/llm"

##
# A simple tool that the LLM will call when it could answer
# a user's query. Its return value is consumed by the LLM.
class System < LLM::Tool
  name "system"
  description "Run a shell command"
  parameter :command, String, "Command to execute"
  required %i[command]

  def call(command:)
    {output: `#{command}`}
  end
end

##
# A sequel model that wraps an instance of LLM::Context. It is highly
# configurable but lets keep it simple :) The 'persistent' option opts
# into a process-wide net-http-persistent connection pool.
class Context < Sequel::Model
  plugin :llm, provider: :set_provider, context: :set_context

  private

  def set_provider
    LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_KEY"]).persistent
  end

  def set_context
    {model: "gpt-5.4-mini", tools: [System]}
  end
end

##
# We create a new record, then update the record every time we call
# 'talk' on the model.
ctx = Context.create
ctx.talk("What files are in my home directory?")
res = ctx.talk(ctx.functions.call)
puts res.content
```

## Tools

Tools in llm.rb can be defined as classes inheriting from `LLM::Tool` or as
closures using `LLM.function`. The same execution model covers provider tool
calls, local tools, and MCP-exposed tools.

At the context level, tool execution is explicit. The model can request work,
the context records pending functions, and your code decides when to execute
them and feed the results back in.

### Tool Calling

When the LLM requests a tool call, the context stores `Function` objects in
`ctx.functions`. `call(:functions)` executes the pending work and returns the
results to the model.

This explicit flow is one of the main design choices in llm.rb. The model can
request work, but your code stays in control of when that work runs and how
its results get fed back in:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class System < LLM::Tool
  name "system"
  description "Run a shell command"
  parameter :command, String, "Command to execute"
  required %i[command]

  def call(command:)
    {success: system(command)}
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout, tools: [System])
ctx.talk("Run `date`.")
ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)) while ctx.functions.any?
```

### Stateful Tool Instances

Explicit `tools:` arrays can also include bound
[`LLM::Tool`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Tool.html) instances, not
just tool classes. That is useful when a tool needs to wrap local state such
as configuration, credentials, or an object from the surrounding application.

The execution model stays the same. The instance is adapted into a normal
tool call, so it still works with
[`LLM::Context`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html),
`ctx.functions`, `ctx.wait(:thread)`, `ctx.wait(:task)`, `ctx.wait(:fiber)`,
and streamed callbacks such as `on_tool_call` and `on_tool_return`. The
current `:ractor` mode still requires class-based tools:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class SearchDocs < LLM::Tool
  name "search_docs"
  description "Search a documentation index"
  parameter :query, String, "Query to search"
  required %i[query]

  def initialize(index:)
    @index = index
  end

  def call(query:)
    {results: @index.search(query)}
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: [SearchDocs.new(index: docs_index)])
ctx.talk("Search the docs for context compaction.")
ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)) while ctx.functions.any?
```

### Cancelling A Function

Because pending tool calls are explicit `LLM::Function` objects, your code can
decide not to run them and return a cancellation result instead.

This is useful when tool execution depends on user confirmation, policy checks,
or any other application-level gate. The model requests work, but your code can
still stop it before the function actually runs:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class System < LLM::Tool
  name "system"
  description "Run a shell command"
  parameter :command, String, "Command to execute"
  required %i[command]

  def call(command:)
    {success: system(command)}
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: [System])

ctx.talk("Run `date` and `uname -a`.")

approved = ctx.functions.select do |fn|
  print "Run #{fn.name}? [y/N] "
  STDIN.gets.to_s.strip.downcase == "y"
end

returns = ctx.functions.map do |fn|
  if approved.include?(fn)
    fn.call
  else
    fn.cancel(reason: "user declined to run the function")
  end
end

ctx.talk(returns)
```

### Cooperative Tool Interruption

`ctx.interrupt!` cancels the active provider request first, then notifies any
queued tool work through `on_interrupt`. This is cooperative cleanup, not
forced termination, so it is most useful for tools that manage local resources
such as subprocesses, sockets, or temporary files.

`LLM::Context` is still a stateful object and is best kept thread-local for
normal use. But interruption is a valid cross-thread control path. That makes
it a good fit for cases like a websocket, where one connection can carry many
messages and a later message may need to cancel an earlier in-flight request.

The basic request-cancellation path looks like this:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "io/console"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout)
worker = Thread.new do
  ctx.talk("Write a very long essay about network protocols.")
rescue LLM::Interrupt
  puts "Request was interrupted!"
end
STDIN.getch
ctx.interrupt!
worker.join
```

Override `on_interrupt` on a tool when it needs to react to cancellation too:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class System < LLM::Tool
  attr_reader :pid

  name "system"
  description "Run a shell command"
  parameter :command, String, "Command to execute"
  required %i[command]

  def call(command:)
    @pid = spawn(command)
    Process.wait(pid)
    {success: $?.success?}
  end

  def on_interrupt
    Process.kill("TERM", pid) if pid
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: [System], stream: LLM::Stream.new)
Thread.new { ctx.talk("Run `sleep 30`.") }
sleep 0.5
ctx.interrupt!
```

### Closure-Based Tools

For smaller cases, `LLM.function` gives you a closure-based alternative to
`LLM::Tool`:

This is useful when you want a quick function without defining a class. The
main limitation is that `LLM.function` does not register a tool class in
`LLM::Tool.registry`, so features that depend specifically on global
tool-class registration still only apply to `LLM::Tool` subclasses.
Request-local streamed tool resolution is no longer one of those limits:
`LLM::Stream` now resolves the current request tools first, so
`LLM.function(...)`, MCP tools, bound tool instances, and normal tool classes
all work through the same streamed tool path:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

weather = LLM.function(:weather) do |fn|
  fn.description "Return the weather for a city"
  fn.params do |schema|
    schema.object(city: schema.string.required)
  end
  fn.define do |city:|
    {city:, forecast: "sunny", high_c: 23}
  end
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: [weather])
ctx.talk("What is the weather in Lisbon?")
ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)) while ctx.functions.any?
```

### Concurrent Tools

Use `wait(:thread)`, `wait(:fiber)`, `wait(:task)`, `wait(:fork)`, or
experimental `wait(:ractor)` when you want multiple pending tool calls to run
concurrently. For CPU-intensive local work, llm.rb supports both `:fork` and
`:ractor`. `:fork` requires
[`xchan.rb`](https://github.com/0x1eef/xchan.rb#readme) support. The current
`:ractor` mode is intended for class-based tools and does not support MCP
tools, but mixed workloads can still route MCP tools and local tools through
different strategies at runtime. Class-based `:ractor` tools still emit
normal tool tracer callbacks, while `:task`, `:fiber`, or `:thread` may be a
better fit for I/O-bound work.
`:fiber` uses `Fiber.schedule`, so it requires `Fiber.scheduler`.

This matters when a turn fans out into several independent tool calls. Instead
of blocking on each one in sequence, you can resolve them together and reduce
end-to-end latency:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(
  llm,
  stream: $stdout,
  tools: [FetchWeather, FetchNews, FetchStock]
)

ctx.talk("Summarize the weather, headlines, and stock price.")
ctx.talk(ctx.wait(:thread)) while ctx.functions.any?
```

## Agents

`LLM::Agent` gives you a reusable, preconfigured assistant built on top of
the same context, tool, and schema primitives. It keeps the same stateful
runtime surface as `LLM::Context`, but wraps it in automatic tool-loop
execution. That makes it a good fit when you want to package instructions,
model choice, tools, output shape, and tool concurrency into one class.

The main difference from `LLM::Context` is control flow. An agent will apply
its instructions automatically and keep executing tool calls until the turn
settles or it hits the configured limit. Tool execution can stay sequential
with `concurrency :call`, or run through `:thread`, `:task`, `:fiber`,
`:fork`, or experimental `:ractor` depending on how you want pending
functions resolved. For CPU-intensive local work, llm.rb supports both
`:fork` and `:ractor`. `:fork` requires
[`xchan.rb`](https://github.com/0x1eef/xchan.rb#readme) support. The current
`:ractor` mode is intended for class-based tools with ractor-safe arguments
and return values, and class-based `:ractor` tools still emit normal tool
tracer callbacks. MCP tools are not supported.
or it hits the configured limit. By default, the tool attempt budget is `25`.
When it exhausts that budget, it sends advisory tool errors back through the
model and keeps the loop in-band instead of raising out of the agent runtime.
Set `tool_attempts: nil` to disable that advisory behavior. Tool execution can
stay sequential with `concurrency :call`, or run through `:thread`, `:task`,
`:fiber`, `:fork`, or experimental `:ractor` depending on how you want
pending functions resolved. For CPU-intensive local work, llm.rb supports both
`:fork` and `:ractor`. `:fork` requires
[`xchan.rb`](https://github.com/0x1eef/xchan.rb#readme) support. The current
`:ractor` mode is intended for class-based tools with ractor-safe arguments
and return values, and class-based `:ractor` tools still emit normal tool
tracer callbacks. MCP tools are not supported. `:fiber` uses
`Fiber.schedule`, so it requires `Fiber.scheduler`.

Built into that loop is the wrapped context's `guard`, which gives llm.rb a
way to supervise agentic execution when a context is no longer making
progress. `LLM::Agent` enables a guard by default, but the capability itself
lives on [`LLM::Context`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html)
so it can also be used outside the agent DSL.

Those agent-level defaults are not fixed. You can still override things like
`model`, `tools`, `schema`, `stream`, or `concurrency` when you initialize the
agent, and you can continue overriding request-level options again at the
`talk` or `respond` call site.

An agent example:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class SystemAdmin < LLM::Agent
  model "gpt-4.1"
  instructions "You are a Linux system admin"
  tools Shell
  schema Result
  concurrency :thread
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
agent = SystemAdmin.new(llm)
res = agent.talk("Run 'date' and summarize the result.")
puts res.content
```

### Guards

Guards are a context-level capability for supervising agentic execution.
Instead of blindly allowing a context to keep issuing tool calls, a guard can
inspect the current runtime state and decide whether pending tool work should
be blocked.

The public interface is intentionally small: a guard only needs to implement
`call(ctx)`. It should return `nil` when execution should continue, or return
a warning string when the context should stop the current tool loop and turn
that warning into in-band guarded tool errors.

[`LLM::LoopGuard`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/LoopGuard.html) is
the built-in implementation. It is directly inspired by General Intelligence
Systems and detects repeated assistant tool-call patterns by reducing them to
`[tool_name, arguments]` signatures.

It catches both:
- repeated identical calls such as `[A, A, A]`
- repeated sequences such as `[A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C]`

When a repeating tail is found, the context does not queue more tool work.
Instead it returns guarded tool errors, which gives the model a chance to
recover without breaking tool-call ordering or wasting more turns.

This does not replace the overall tool-loop attempt cap. Guards help the
runtime intervene earlier, while the attempt limit still gives the loop a
hard stop for long or non-repeating bad behavior.

The built-in `LLM::Agent` path enables `guard: true` by default:

```ruby
class Agent < LLM::Agent
  model "gpt-5.4-mini"
  tools SearchDocs, Shell
end
```

You can also configure a guard directly on a context:

```ruby
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: [SearchDocs, Shell], guard: true)
```

Or supply your own guard implementation:

```ruby
class Guard
  def call(ctx)
    return unless suspicious?(ctx)
    "Repeated tool pattern detected. Stop and try a different strategy."
  end

  private

  def suspicious?(ctx)
    ctx.functions.any? && ctx.messages.to_a.size > 20
  end
end

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, tools: [SearchDocs, Shell], guard: Guard.new)
```

### Transformers

Transformers are the companion capability to guards. Where a guard decides
whether execution should continue, a transformer rewrites the outgoing prompt
and params before a request is sent to the provider.

The public interface is intentionally small: a transformer implements
`call(ctx, prompt, params)` and returns `[prompt, params]`. That makes it a
good fit for cross-cutting concerns such as PII scrubbing, prompt
normalization, or injecting request-level defaults like `store: false`. It
also means a transformer can scrub plain text prompts or
[`LLM::Function::Return`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Function/Return.html)
values. In other words, you can intercept a tool call's return value and
modify it before sending it back to the LLM.

This is especially useful when you want context-wide behavior without
rewriting every `talk` and `respond` call site by hand.

When a stream is present, transformer lifecycle hooks are also exposed through
[`LLM::Stream`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Stream.html) with
`on_transform` and `on_transform_finish`. That gives a UI a clean way to say
`Anonymizing your data...` before a scrubber runs and `Data anonymized.`
after it finishes.

For example, a simple transformer can scrub email addresses before the model
ever sees them. It can also handle `Array` prompts and
`LLM::Function::Return` objects:

```ruby
class ScrubPII
  EMAIL = /\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b/i

  def call(ctx, prompt, params)
    [scrub(prompt), params]
  end

  private

  def scrub(prompt)
    case prompt
    when String then prompt.gsub(EMAIL, "[REDACTED_EMAIL]")
    when Array then prompt.map { scrub(_1) }
    when LLM::Function::Return then on_tool_return(prompt)
    else prompt
    end
  end

  def on_tool_return(result)
    value = case result.name
    when "lookup-customer" then scrub_value(result.value)
    else result.value
    end
    LLM::Function::Return.new(result.id, result.name, value)
  end

  def scrub_value(value)
    case value
    when String then value.gsub(EMAIL, "[REDACTED_EMAIL]")
    when Array then value.map { scrub_value(_1) }
    when Hash then value.transform_values { scrub_value(_1) }
    else value
    end
  end
end

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.transformer = ScrubPII.new
ctx.talk("Email me at developer@example.com")
```

Transformers can also rewrite params, not just prompt content:

```ruby
class Transformer
  def call(ctx, prompt, params)
    [prompt, params.merge(store: false)]
  end
end

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, mode: :responses)
ctx.transformer = Transformer.new
```

## Skills

[`LLM::Skill`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Skill.html) lets you
package a capability as a directory with a `SKILL.md` file and then run that
capability through the normal llm.rb tool path. Frontmatter can define `name`,
`description`, and `tools`, where `tools` are resolved by name through the
tool registry. [`LLM::Agent`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html)
can declare skills with `skills ...`, and
[`LLM::Context`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Context.html) also
accepts `skills:` directly when you want lower-level control. If you are
familiar with skills in Claude or Codex, llm.rb supports the same general
pattern.

In llm.rb, a skill is not just a prompt pack or discovery document. It is
adapted into a callable tool through the normal runtime, and when that tool
is called it spawns a sub-agent through
[`LLM::Agent`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html) with
relevant context plus the instructions and tool subset declared in its own
`SKILL.md`.

The `tools` entries in skill frontmatter are tool names, not classes. Each
name must resolve to a subclass of
[`LLM::Tool`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Tool.html) that is
already loaded in the current llm.rb runtime.

If you want Claude/Codex-like skills that can drive scripts or shell
commands, you would typically pair the skill with a tool that can execute
system commands.

An example `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: release
description: Prepare a release
tools:
  - search_docs
  - git
---
Review the release state, summarize what changed, and prepare the release.
```

The execution flow is:

1. `skills "...path..."` loads `SKILL.md`.
2. Frontmatter `tools:` entries resolve by name through the
   [`LLM::Tool`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Tool.html) registry.
3. The skill is adapted into a callable tool in the runtime.
4. When called, the skill spawns a sub-agent through
   [`LLM::Agent`](https://0x1eef.github.io/x/llm.rb/LLM/Agent.html).
5. That sub-agent inherits selected parent context settings and relevant
   context, but it runs only with the instructions and tools declared by the
   skill.

The release skill runs only with the tools declared in its own frontmatter.
That is what makes skills feel like bounded executable capabilities instead
of generic instruction documents.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

class Agent < LLM::Agent
  model "gpt-5.4-mini"
  instructions "You are a concise release assistant."
  skills "./skills/release"
  tracer { LLM::Tracer::Logger.new(llm, path: "logs/release-agent.log") }
end

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
puts Agent.new(llm).talk("Use the release skill.").content
```

## MCP

MCP lets llm.rb treat external services, internal APIs, and prompt libraries
as part of the same execution path.

`LLM::MCP` is a stateful client that can connect over stdio or HTTP, list
tools and prompts, and adapt them into the same runtime model used by
contexts and agents.

### MCP Tools Over Stdio

Use stdio when the MCP server runs as a local process. This is the most direct
way to connect local utilities and developer tools into a context.

Use `mcp.run do ... end` when the client only needs to live for one scoped
block. Use `mcp.start` and `mcp.stop` directly when you want finer sequential
control across multiple steps before cleanup.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
mcp = LLM::MCP.stdio(
  argv: ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", Dir.pwd]
)
mcp.run do
  ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout, tools: mcp.tools)
  ctx.talk("List the directories in this project.")
  ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)) while ctx.functions.any?
end
```

### MCP Tools Over HTTP

If you expect repeated tool calls, use `persistent` to reuse a process-wide
HTTP connection pool. This requires the optional `net-http-persistent` gem:

Use HTTP when the MCP server is remote or shared across machines. The
persistent client helps when the workflow makes repeated MCP requests. The
GitHub example below expects a token in `ENV["GITHUB_PAT"]`.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
mcp = LLM::MCP.http(
  url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
  headers: {"Authorization" => "Bearer #{ENV.fetch("GITHUB_PAT")}"},
  persistent: true
)
mcp.run do
  ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout, tools: mcp.tools)
  ctx.talk("List the available GitHub MCP toolsets.")
  ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)) while ctx.functions.any?
end
```

When you need more control over ordering, start the client explicitly and stop
it yourself after the sequential steps are done:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
mcp = LLM::MCP.http(
  url: "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
  headers: {"Authorization" => "Bearer #{ENV.fetch("GITHUB_PAT")}"},
  persistent: true
)

mcp.start
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm, stream: $stdout, tools: mcp.tools)
ctx.talk("List the available GitHub MCP toolsets.")
ctx.talk(ctx.call(:functions)) while ctx.functions.any?
mcp.stop
```

### MCP Prompts

MCP servers can also expose prompt templates. llm.rb can list those prompts
and fetch a specific prompt by name. Retrieved prompt messages are normalized
into `LLM::Message` objects, and the raw MCP payload stays available in
`extra.original_content`.

This is useful when prompts live outside the application and need to be
fetched by name, optionally with arguments, before being passed into a
context or agent:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

mcp = LLM::MCP.stdio(argv: ["npx", "-y", "@mcpservers/prompt-library"])
mcp.run do
  prompts = mcp.prompts
  prompt = mcp.find_prompt(
    name: "suggest_code_error_fix",
    arguments: {
      "code_error" => "undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass",
      "function_name" => "render_profile"
    }
  )

  puts prompts.map(&:name)
  puts prompt.messages.first.content
  puts prompt.messages.first.extra.original_content.type
end
```

## Multimodal Prompts

Contexts provide helpers for composing prompts that include images, audio,
documents, and provider-managed files.

These helpers normalize non-text inputs before they reach the provider
adapter. That keeps the prompt-building code in Ruby while still letting each
provider receive the shape it expects.

In practice, that means a prompt can be:
- a string
- an `LLM::Prompt`
- an array of prompt parts

When you use an array, each element can be plain text or a tagged object such
as `ctx.image_url(...)`, `ctx.local_file(...)`, or `ctx.remote_file(...)`.
Those tagged objects carry enough information for the provider adapter to turn
the prompt into the provider-specific multimodal shape.

### Image Input

Image helpers let you build multimodal prompts without manually assembling
provider-specific payloads.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)

res = ctx.talk ["Describe this image", ctx.image_url("https://example.com/cat.jpg")]
puts res.content
```

### Audio Generation

Provider media APIs are exposed alongside chat APIs, so the same provider
object can also handle speech output.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
res = llm.audio.create_speech(input: "Hello world")
IO.copy_stream res.audio, File.join(Dir.home, "hello.mp3")
```

### Image Generation

Image generation follows the same pattern: call the provider API, then handle
the returned file or stream in normal Ruby code.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
res = llm.images.create(prompt: "a dog on a rocket to the moon")
IO.copy_stream res.images[0], File.join(Dir.home, "dogonrocket.png")
```

## Retrieval And Files

When you want to index content or use provider-side retrieval APIs, llm.rb
exposes files, embeddings, and vector stores directly.

This is useful when the workflow needs more than chat completion. You can
upload content, build embeddings, create vector stores, and query them from
the same provider object you already use for prompts and contexts.

### Embeddings

Embeddings are the basic building block for semantic search, clustering, and
retrieval workflows.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
res = llm.embed([
  "programming is fun",
  "ruby is a programming language",
  "sushi is art"
])

puts res.class
puts res.embeddings.size
puts res.embeddings[0].size
```

### Files And Vector Stores

When you want provider-side retrieval, file uploads and vector stores let the
provider index your content and search over it directly.

When you already have a local file and the model understands that file type,
you can also pass it inline through `ctx.local_file(...)` without using the
provider Files API first:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.talk ["Summarize this document.", ctx.local_file("README.md")]
```

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "pp"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
file = llm.files.create(path: "README.md")
store = llm.vector_stores.create_and_poll(name: "Docs", file_ids: [file.id])
res = llm.vector_stores.search(vector: store, query: "What does llm.rb do?")

res.each { pp _1 }
```

## Tracing

Assign a tracer to a provider and all context requests and tool calls made
through that provider will be instrumented.

Tracing is attached at the provider level, so the same tracer follows normal
requests, tool execution, and higher-level workflows built on contexts or
agents. That keeps observability close to the runtime model instead of adding
it as a separate wrapper later:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
llm.tracer = LLM::Tracer::Logger.new(llm, io: $stdout)

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.talk("Hello")
```

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
llm.tracer = LLM::Tracer::Telemetry.new(llm)

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.talk("Hello")
pp llm.tracer.spans
```

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
llm.tracer = LLM::Tracer::Langsmith.new(
  llm,
  metadata: {env: "dev"},
  tags: ["chatbot"]
)

ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.talk("Hello")
```

## Production And Operations

These are the pieces you reach for once the workflow itself is working.

Most of them are small switches rather than a second framework. Providers are
meant to be shared, contexts are meant to stay isolated, and performance or
cost controls layer onto the same core objects.

### Production Basics

These are the default operational assumptions behind the library. They are
simple, but getting them right early makes the rest of the workflow more
predictable.

- **Thread-safe providers** — share `LLM::Provider` instances across the app
- **Thread-local contexts** — keep `LLM::Context` instances state-isolated
- **Cost tracking** — estimate spend without extra API calls
- **Persistence** — save and restore contexts across processes
- **Performance** — swap JSON adapters and enable HTTP connection pooling
- **Error handling** — structured errors instead of unpredictable exceptions

### Thread Safety

Providers are designed to be shared. Contexts should generally stay local to
one thread.

That split is intentional. Providers are mostly configuration and transport,
while contexts hold mutable workflow state:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])

Thread.new do
  ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
  ctx.talk("Hello from thread 1")
end

Thread.new do
  ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
  ctx.talk("Hello from thread 2")
end
```

### Performance Tuning

Swap JSON backends when you need more throughput, and enable persistent HTTP
when request volume makes it worth it.

These are opt-in changes. You can stay on the standard library by default and
only add extra dependencies when the workload justifies them:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

LLM.json = :oj
llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"]).persistent
```

### Model Registry

The local model registry provides metadata about model capabilities, pricing,
and limits without requiring API calls.

This is useful when the application needs to make local decisions about model
selection, limits, or estimated cost:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

registry = LLM.registry_for(:openai)
model_info = registry.limit(model: "gpt-4.1")
puts "Context window: #{model_info.context} tokens"
puts "Cost: $#{model_info.cost.input}/1M input tokens"
```

### Cost Tracking

Contexts accumulate usage as they run, which makes cost tracking available
without a separate accounting layer.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"

llm = LLM.openai(key: ENV["KEY"])
ctx = LLM::Context.new(llm)
ctx.talk "Hello"
puts "Estimated cost so far: $#{ctx.cost}"
ctx.talk "Tell me a joke"
puts "Estimated cost so far: $#{ctx.cost}"
```

## Putting It Together

See how these pieces come together in a complete application architecture with
[Relay](https://github.com/llmrb/relay), a production-ready LLM application
built on llm.rb that demonstrates:

- Context management across requests
- Tool composition and execution
- Concurrent workflows
- Cost tracking and observability
- Production deployment patterns
