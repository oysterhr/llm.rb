  spec.summary = "Lightweight runtime for building capable AI systems in Ruby."

  spec.description = <<~DESCRIPTION
  llm.rb is a lightweight runtime for building capable AI systems in Ruby.
  It is not just an API wrapper. llm.rb gives you one runtime for providers,
  contexts, agents, tools, MCP servers, streaming, schemas, files, and
  persisted state, so real systems can be built out of one coherent
  execution model instead of a pile of adapters. It stays close to Ruby, runs
  on the standard library by default, loads optional pieces only when needed,
  includes built-in ActiveRecord support through acts_as_llm and
  acts_as_agent, includes built-in Sequel support through plugin :llm,
  and is designed for engineers who want control over long-lived,
  tool-capable, stateful AI workflows instead of just request/response
  helpers.
